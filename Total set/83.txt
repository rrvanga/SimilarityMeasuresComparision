Now, the package — which includes "Martha Marcy May Marlene" filmmaker Sean Durkin, who is attached to direct, and the script by Abi Morgan — is setting up shop under the Melrose Ave. watertower.

Little House aired on NBC from 1974 to 1983 and starred Michael Landon as the patriarch of a pioneer family living in the 1880s in the American Midwest.

The show was known for its wholesome values and was a loose adaptation of the classic series of children's books by Laura Ingalls Wilder, who based it on her childhood. (Melissa Gilbert played Laura Wilder on the show.)
