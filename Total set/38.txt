Struggling Minnesota Timberwolves guard Kevin Martin has been engaged in buyout talks with the team since at least Thursday, according to Marc Stein of ESPN.com.  

Stein reported Saturday the San Antonio Spurs are the favorites to sign Martin if he's bought out. He would need to sign with the five-time champs by Tuesday to be playoff-eligible, per Stein:

Martin's 2015-16 salary is $7.1 million, per Spotrac. He has a $7.4 million player option for the 2016-17 season.

The Dallas Mavericks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Atlanta Hawks and Miami Heat have all expressed interest in the veteran, according to Tim McMahon of ESPN.com.

However, the Mavs seem unlikely because they are far behind the Spurs in the Western Conference hunt. And the Heat are expected to sign Joe Johnson, per Shams Charania of The Vertical, so they may not need Martin.

On Thursday, the Wolves bought out Andre Miller to allow him to sign with a playoff team, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical.

The Wolves are 18-40, ahead of only the Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Lakers in the West. Martin has only started 12 of the 39 games he’s played and is averaging 21.4 minutes per contest—his lowest output since his rookie season in 2004-05—as the team continues to develop its younger talent, including Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins.

Minnesota is a team on the rise that should contend for the postseason soon, but Martin doesn’t figure in its long-term plans.
