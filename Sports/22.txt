Hmm.

During a Thursday appearance on Rachel Nichols’ new ESPN show, The Jump, retired NBA forward Stephen Jackson made a bold claim: His 2006-07 Golden State Warriors would beat the current team.

You know, the one that’s on pace to break the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls’ record for the best season ever.

ESPN’s Zach Lowe couldn’t believe it, but Jackson held his ground.

“They’re great. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not taking nothing from them. But we could beat them. We could beat them. We would’ve beaten them.”

Before Stephen Curry came along, the 2006-07 Dubs were the first Golden State team to make the playoffs since 1993-94.

Baron Davis, Monta Ellis, Jason Richardson, Jackson and Al Harrington were the primary contributors. They finished 42-40 and upset the No. 1-seeded Dallas Mavericks in the first round before losing to the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference semifinals.

Curry's Warriors are fresh off a dominant title run and show no signs of slowing down.

Just saying.
